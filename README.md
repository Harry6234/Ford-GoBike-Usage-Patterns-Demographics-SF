# Ford GoBike System Data Exploration

## Introduction

This report explores a dataset that includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset contains 183,412 entries and 16 features(columns) which include duration, start time, end time, station ID, station name, bike ID, user type, and more. 

The purpose of this analysis is to identify trends and insights in the data that can help optimize the bike-sharing system.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contained 183,412 entries with missing data in several columns such as station ID, station name, member birth year, and member gender.

## Key Findings

- The majority of users in the Ford GoBike System are subscribers.
- The age group with the highest frequency of bike rides is between 25-35 years.
- More than 90% of the rides were made by subscribers and only a small percentage of the rides were made by customers.
- Males recorded the highest count among genders with more than 70% of the rides made by males.
- Short rides (less than 10 minutes) are most common.
- Bike sharing was not common among users.

## Key Insights

Based on the findings, the following key insights can be drawn:

- The bike-sharing system is most popular among subscribers, especially males aged between 25-35 years.
- More marketing strategies should be directed towards attracting the female population to increase the gender diversity of users.
- The system should be optimized for short rides as they are the most common and can lead to increased profits.
- Since bike sharing was not popular among users, the system can explore strategies to encourage bike sharing for all trips.
