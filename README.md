This report analyzes the Ford GoBike System, a bike-sharing system in the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset includes 183,412 rides made by individual users, with 16 features such as duration, start and end times, start and end stations, bike ID, user type, and member demographics. 

## Key Findings

From the exploratory analysis, the following key findings were identified:
